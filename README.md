### INTRODUCTION
Modern lifestyle and dietary habits contribute to the increased prevalence of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Factors such as lack of regular exercise, consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks, smoking, and chronic stress contribute to the rising incidence of thesehealthconditions.Diabetes,characterized by high blood sugar levels, is strongly linked to unhealthy lifestyle choices, including poor diet and physicalinactivity. Similarly, heart disease, the leading cause of death globally, often stems from a combination of factors such as an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and obesity. Cancer, another significant health concern, can be influenced by dietary factors such as 
consumption of processed meats and sugary drinks, along with other lifestyle choices. By aiding in disease diagnosis, maximizing treatment plans, identifying fraud, and forecasting future health hazards, data mining is essential in tackling these health issues.
